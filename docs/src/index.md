# About

`AutoViz` is a package for visualizing simple traffic scenarios using Cairo.
It is primarily designed to provide rendering support for
[`AutomotiveDrivingModels.jl`](https://github.com/sisl/AutomotiveDrivingModels.jl).
The framework currently supports building blocks such as roadways,
vehicles and pedestrians and can be easily extended.

The tutorials provide a sequence of simple examples showcasing some of the main
features of the `AutoViz` package, such as
 - basic rendering of vehicles and roadways
 - demo of the available camera behaviors
 - adding additional information through overlays

!!! note
    All AutoViz tutorials are available as
    [Jupyter notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
    by clicking on the badge at the beginning of the notebook!

The Manual section lists more details of the provided functions,
which can also be accessed through the Julia REPL by typing `?function_name`.
